âœ… WHAT I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DONE

ðŸ”¹ 1. Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
Created a backend project: mpesa-backend

Installed required packages: express, axios, dotenv, moment

Wrote an index.js and stkpush.js file to handle:

/stkpush â†’ initiates the payment

/callback â†’ receives M-Pesa's payment status


ðŸ”¹ 2. Environment Configuration
Created a .env file to store:

CONSUMER_KEY

CONSUMER_SECRET

PASSKEY (for shortcode 174379)

CALLBACK_URL (public Ngrok URL)


PORT

ðŸ”¹ 3. Ngrok Setup
Downloaded and installed Ngrok

Authenticated Ngrok with your token

Started a tunnel to your backend using:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 3000
Got a public URL like https://abc.ngrok-free.app


ðŸ”¹ 4. Connected Android App to Backend
Your Kotlin PaymentViewModel is correctly sending the STK push to the Node.js backend using Retrofit.

Backend receives and processes the request.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Postman Testing
Successfully tested your /stkpush endpoint via Postman with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "phone": "254708374149",
  "amount": 100
}
Backend responded (or is about to respond) with M-Pesa API output.
